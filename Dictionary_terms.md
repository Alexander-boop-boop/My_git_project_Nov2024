# Dictionary and concepts 

- Git: Time line
- GitHub: Backup of your timeline

## Conceptual Areas

1. Dev. area: Folder where the project is developed
2. Staging area: A space to prepare for a snapshot that will go in my timeline. When making unrelated changes and dont want to commit them together you can use the staging area to commit one-by-one.
3. Local repository: The timeline
4. Remote repository: Back up of the timeline, in this case in GitHub.

What happens if I forget the -m in the commit ?
